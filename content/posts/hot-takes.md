## "Publish a list of your hot takes," you say
No. I don't have enough courage to put all of that on the internet and hot takes are, by definition, likely to met with disagreement and in some cases offense and anger.... Okay maybe I will publish some later.

## Some Hot Takes I've Heard (Not Necessarily Mine)
- _No one has ever learned anything from reading_
- [antinatalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinatalism)
- Politicians are all lizard people (okay... maybe this one is actually not a hot take)
